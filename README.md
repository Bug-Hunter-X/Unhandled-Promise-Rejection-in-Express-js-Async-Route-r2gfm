# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper error handling within asynchronous route handlers.  The provided `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where an asynchronous operation might throw an error. The error is caught, but it's not passed to the Express error handling middleware using `next(error)`, leading to a loss of detailed error information and potentially unhelpful responses to the client.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses `next(error)` for proper error propagation. This allows for centralized error handling and more informative error responses.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to execute the flawed code.  Observe the lack of specific error information in the console and the generic error message received in the browser.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to execute the corrected code. Observe the improved console logging, including the detailed error information, and an error response that conveys information about the underlying failure. 

## Key Learning

Always use `next(error)` within asynchronous route handlers to propagate errors to Express.js error handling middleware, ensuring proper error logging and informative responses. Failure to do so can lead to hidden bugs and difficulties in debugging production issues.
